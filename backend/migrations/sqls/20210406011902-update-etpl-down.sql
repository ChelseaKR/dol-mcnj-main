CORE is a foundation course in hair cutting, color, texture, styling, skin and nails, and an introduction to our Paul Mitchell Schools culture. Future Professionals learn cosmetology fundamentals in theory, and then practice them hands-on in the safe environment of the classroom. You''ll work on mannequin heads and receive close, personal attention from a Learning Leader who will guide you every step of the way.

You''ll work on mannequin heads and receive close, personal attention from a Learning Leader who will guide you every step of the way.

LEVEL 2 ADAPTIVE
During the ADAPTIVE phase, the learning continues in the classroom and on the clinic floor classroom, where Future Professionals practice and perfect the fundamental skills learned in Core. Adaptive-level students work on live models in a salon-like environment with the oversight and support of their Learning Leaders. You will work with professional products and learn how to conduct client consultations and create extraordinary guest-service experiences.

LEVEL 3 CREATIVE
Future Professionals expand their skills and are introduced to more advanced and creative techniques during the CREATIVE phase. At the Creative level, students prepare to become salon-ready by working more independently at a pace and in conditions that are similar to those in a salon. You will also develop your speed, build a resume and portfolio, and prepare to pass the cosmetology state board exam.

PHASE TWO
PHASE TWO clinic classroom is an optional course of intensive study within the Cosmetology program for those Future Professionals who want to be challenged to their highest level of performance.
