At Merit, our approach to learning is very different from other schools.  We don''t believe in modules and revolving start dates.  We strongly feel that every student is best educated by starting at only one point, the beginning. We never allow students to start in the middle of our program, or after a ''module''.  Topics continue to come up and proficiency is built over time, so students retain their new knowledge.  Merit Training Institute offers Lifetime Placement Assistance. Free professional resume writing services are included in each course. Our Placement Coordinator works closely with our students on cover-letter writing, interview preparation, and follow-up techniques. It is our primary goal to ensure that our graduates obtain long lasting employment in their field of study and enjoy a fulfilling career. Upon graduation, you are eligible to take 5 national certification exams: American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC)¿s Certified Professional Coder (CPC), National Center for Competency Testing (NCCT)¿s Nationally Certified Insurance and Coding Specialist (NCICS), National Healthcareer Association''s (NHA) Certified Medical Administrative Assistant (CMAA), Certified Billing & Coding Specialist (CBCS) and Certified Electronic Health Records Specialist (CEHRS).

We offer a Student Resource Area for both our current students and graduates.
